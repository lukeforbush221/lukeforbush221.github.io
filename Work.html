<P>I work at a restaurant called "The Deckhouse" as a line cook. Working in this place was a promotion from working in the fun park(Seacoast Fun Park) that the owners also own. I was paid significantly more and given a lot more responsibility. Although it can be very stressful at times I honestly do not mind my job. The busy days go by fast, and because of the relationships I have with my co-workers, the slow days aren't awful either. The food is great(cooked by me so of course), and the atmosphere is equal. There is typically live music Friday and Saturday nights and the people at the bar love to dance out on the floor. Its a great job!</p>
