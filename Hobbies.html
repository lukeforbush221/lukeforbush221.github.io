<title> A Lazy Man's life </title>
<Body>
<center> <H1> What do I do on a daily basis you ask?<H1> </center>
<P1> Since getting to college my days have consisted mainly of, reading, homework, and wallowing in self pity. For these reasons I have not gotten particularly involved in any clubs or activities, but I still have about three and a half years left to change that. However I am not a completely boring person so here are my top five favorite ways to spend my time, just so you can get to know me a bit better(in random order): </p1> 
<UL> 
<LI> Spending time with family and Friends </LI>
<LI> Playing Video Games</LI>
<LI> Eating </LI>
<LI> Playing Volleyball </LI>
<LI> Swimming </LI> </UL>

<P2> I like to be try new things and keep myself busy just as much as I like to sleep all day! Very interesting, huh?</p2>
