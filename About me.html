<center><b> <H1> A quick biography about me: </h1></b> </center>
<P> 	I was born on May 13th, 1998 in York, Maine. I spent the first four years of my life living in York where I went to pre-school. Right before my 5th birthday my family decided to move to Windham, Maine where I grew up for the most part. I am very thankful for this move because Windham was an amazing place to grow up. I made life-long friends there, and most of them are attending UMO without me!</p>
<p>	From third grade until I graduated I played football and I honestly was not too shabby at it. I played center and received an all-conference award at the end of my senior year. I always hated the work and effort needed to do well in the sport but in hindsight I am very happy with myself for sticking with it. Other than football I didn't play any other sports besides baseball my freshmen(but I was terrible).</p>
<p>	Obviously I decided to go to UMO after high-school, and I was accepted early through an interview I signed up for. There were only 20 spots for people to be interviewed, but I already knew I wanted to go so I was right on top of it. I was happy to be rid of the stress of being accepted to college so early. So far I have loved it up here and I am happy with my choice of being a business major.</p>
